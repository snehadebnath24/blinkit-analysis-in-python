# blinkit-analysis-in-python

### 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the Blinkit sales dataset to understand how outlet characteristics (location, size, establishment year) and product attributes (item fat content) impact total sales.
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations, we aim to uncover which outlets perform best, what product types drive revenue, and how store features influence sales.



### ✅ Business Objective

- Identify outlet types, sizes, and locations that generate the highest sales.
- Analyze how item fat content affects sales distribution.
- Understand sales trends by outlet establishment year.
- Provide actionable insights for outlet strategy, expansion, and product planning.

### 🛠️ Analytical Approach

- Data Aggregation
- Grouped data by Outlet Location Type, Item Fat Content, Outlet Size, and Outlet Establishment Year.
- Summed sales for each group to compare performance.

### Visualizations

- 📊 Bar Chart: Sales by Outlet Tier & Item Fat Content
- 📉 Line Chart: Sales trend by Outlet Establishment Year
- 🥧 Pie Chart: Sales share by Outlet Size
- 📊 Horizontal Bar Chart: Sales by Outlet Location Type


### 💡 Key Insights

- Outlet Location plays a major role: some tiers contribute significantly more to sales.
- Regular-fat items generally outperform low-fat items in terms of revenue.
- Larger outlets capture a bigger share of sales compared to smaller ones.
- Outlets established in certain years (neither oldest nor newest) show stronger sales performance.
